#Startup Office

We think it's important that we should have few basic things in the startup.
Many are not required but this will be a check list. Before starting up a new startup.
Please feel free to contribute to this list. But remember that this list is for a startup with 4-10 people.

## About Remote Startup?
We hope all startup's are remote but that doesn't work until you understand who remote startup works.
Remote startup is a great Idea. But it's not good until your product/application in the alpha/launch stage.

## Fun things and Policies

Many times we forget about everything. We plan for so many things and you forget them.
We don't want our guys to work for more time we want them to be productive.
So make of implement few things. Depending on the task allocate a time for fun tasks.

We have divided them as days into policies. 
+ Monday Movie (6-9PM)
+ Tuesday Treking (6-11AM)
+ Wednesday Discussion(6-8PM)
+ Thursday Gaming(6-9/11PM)
+ Friday Clubbing/Pubbing(10PM-1AM)
+ Saturday Sporting(4-7PM)
+ Sunday - Do nothing or Get together with family/friends.

Best is to make them policies based on the week.
