#Startup Office

We think it's important that start-up's should have few basic things in their office.
The below list many aren't required depends on your startup but it will be a check list.
Please feel free to contribute to this list. But remember that this list is for a startup with 4-10 people.

## About Remote Startup?
We hope all startup's should work as remote but that doesn't work until you understand how the remote startup really works.
Remote startup is a great Idea. But it's not good until your product/application in the alpha/launch stage.

## Fun things and Policies

Many times we forget about everything we have planned, we want them to be productive.
So, implement few things depending on the task by allocating some time instead on just planning.
We have divided them as days made them policies.

+ Monday Movie (6-9PM)
+ Tuesday Treking (6-11AM)
+ Wednesday Discussion(6-8PM)
+ Thursday Gaming(6-9/11PM)
+ Friday Clubbing/Pubbing(10PM-1AM)
+ Saturday Sporting(4-7PM)
+ Sunday - Do nothing or Get together with family/friends.

Best is to make them policies based on the week. 

+ Ping-Pong table
+ Pool table
+ Carrom Board
+ Football Table
+ XBox/PS4
+ Sleeping pods
+ Celebrating Cultural and Seasons.
+ A dog / A cat - No reptiles.
